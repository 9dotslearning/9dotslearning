@9dotslearning is an online place for young students, especially in middle school, to learn about coding. 

It's not exactly a business. It's not exactly a school. It's a place where, I hope, magic comes first.

I'm currently working on lessons in p5.js for beginners.

You can reach me at 9dotslearning@gmail.com.
